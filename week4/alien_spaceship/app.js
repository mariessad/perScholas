// Build a game of battling alien spaceships using Javascript.
// Earth has been attacked by a horde of aliens! You are the captain of the USS HelloWorld, on a mission to destroy every last alien ship.

// Battle the aliens as you try to destroy them with your lasers.

// There are six alien ships. The aliens' weakness is that they are too logical and attack one at a time:
// they will wait to see the outcome of a battle before deploying another alien ship.
//  Your strength is that you have the initiative and get to attack first.
// However, you do not have targeting lasers and can only attack the aliens in order.
//  After you have destroyed a ship, you have the option to make a hasty retreat.

// A game round would look like this:
// You attack the first alien ship

// If the ship survives, it attacks you

// If you survive, you attack the ship again

// If it survives, it attacks you again â€¦ etc

// If you destroy the ship, you have the option to attack the next ship or to retreat

// If you retreat, the game is over, perhaps leaving the game open for further developments or options

// You win the game if you destroy all of the aliens

// You lose the game if you are destroyed

// Ship Properties
// hull is the same as hitpoints. If hull reaches 0 or less, the ship is destroyed

// firepower is the amount of damage done to the hull of the target with a successful hit

// accuracy is the chance between 0 and 1 that the ship will hit its target

// Your spaceship, the USS HelloWorld should have the following properties:

// hull - 20
// firepower - 5
// accuracy - .7
// The alien ships should each have the following ranged properties determined randomly:

// hull - between 3 and 6
// firepower - between 2 and 4
// accuracy - between .6 and .8
// You could be battling six alien ships each with unique values.

// Example use of accuracy to determine a hit:

// if (Math.random() < alien[0].accuracy) {
//     console.log('You have been hit!');
// }

// ðŸ‘¾ Where to begin?
// Read over the specifications. Make sure you understand them. If you do not understand them, try to clarify them for yourself.

// Plan the game. This is an act of simplification.

// From these programming principles (Links to an external site.)

// Use pseudo code to get a sketch of your game first.
// Avoid Creating a YAGNI (You aren't going to need it) - You should not try to add functionality until you need it.
// Do the simplest thing that could possibly work.
// Often, beginning something is an act of creative inspiration to find the simplest possible case.
// The first step is not necessarily a matter of logical deduction. Once you have a few 'clues' you can follow the trail of crumbs to a logical conclusion.

// ðŸ‘¾ Actors and then actions
// A good rule of thumb is start with the actors and then the actions. What actors do we need?
// In this case, we need our spaceship and the alien spaceships. An action these ships can take is to attack something.
// Perhaps a ship object (an actor) could therefore have an attack method (an action).

// A repeating action in the game is that these ships attack each other until one of them has been destroyed.
// This might necessitate a loop or multiple loops.

// ðŸ‘¾ Start simpler than the instructions suggest
// Keep these five things in mind when planning and coding your game:

// Begin even simpler than the specifications suggest.
// In this case, perhaps just start with one alien ship instead of many alien ships, and get the code for one ship working first.

// Root out any 'gotchas' that you really ought to foresee. In this case, will we really want nested loops
// -- one for a battle, one for iterating over aliens)? How will we exit one loop and then exit the parent loop?
//  Perhaps keeping it to one loop somehow will help us avoid unnecessary difficulties.

// When coding, form a solid and testable foundation before building upon it with more functionality.
// In this case, is there a bug where an alien can attack after it has been destroyed?
// Better fix that bug before increasing the complexity of the code.

// When you have a piece of functionality tested and working, commit it.
// Try not to commit broken code. Unsure of when to commit? Commit when something works. You want to save working code.

//psuedocode
// create an ship object and an alien object. Create a method for the ship to attack an alien, that method should reduced the aliens points
//make a method for the alien to attack the ship (or should it be the same method? probably because it's going to try to do the same damage)
// make a game object for the game to keep track of health/score, retreat to end the game, or move on to the next ship
